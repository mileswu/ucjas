## Uchi-Con General Convention Rules
- The convention is PG-13. Please keep it that way.
- Laws still apply while at the Con.
- Do not damage or deface the property. Drawing on the chalk board is acceptable.
- Please respect the staff. We are harried University students and can only deal with so much crap.
- If you are 12 and under, you must be accompanied by an adult.
- If it’s not yours, you may not take it. This applies especially to screening laptops, which belong to our volunteers. Don’t ruin our day.
- Please respect the Panels. Our hallways echo, so if there is a panel going on, please bring the volume down or move to another space, such as the Sweets Café or the Regular Café.
- If you are planning on purchasing things at the convention, please bring cash, preferably in singles. We have a limited amount of change, and cannot accommodate large bills for small purchases indefinitely.
- If a problem arises, please do not hesitate to ask a staff member.
 
## Costumes and Props
- Your prop and/or costume should not inhibit anyone else’s path through our admittedly narrow hallways
- No live steel.
- No real firearms.
- The convention is in winter. While we have heating, we do not control the thermostats. Please dress appropriately.
 
## Artist Alley Policies
- All items sold must be made by you or a team member (if any).
- Items must hold to the PG-13 rule. We reserve to right to pull things if they are inappropriate.
- Please bring your own change. We have a limited amount and most of it is in use during the convention.
- Be considerate of those around you.
- You may have to share a table; plan accordingly.
- Please do not block the walkways with your displays.

## Cosplay Contest Policies
