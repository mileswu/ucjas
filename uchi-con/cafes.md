Uchi-Con has two cafes: one serving home-made Japanese and Asian food and one serving home-made desserts and hot beverages.

Reminder both cafes are cash-only, so please remember to bring cash. Unfortunately the nearest ATMs are a couple of blocks away, so this can save you a cold walk in the snow.
