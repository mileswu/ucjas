## Pre-registration
We are now taking pre-registration at our [pre-registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EylkCpTNfVQDso8ty6cfyVSX01zNQ0TCoJqUuuVBEEs/viewform).


Please read the [rules](/uchi-con/rules) thoroughly before registering.
Any questions about the registration process can be sent to reg.ucjas@gmail.com.

## At the door
If you missed the pre-registration deadline, registration on the day of the event is also possible. However, we strongly advise that you pre-register as this can save you from a lengthy line at the registration desk.

## Cost - $0

Admission to Uchi-Con is free of charge. However, you are still required to either pre-register or register at the door to obtain your convention badge. Those seen without convention badges by staff will be required to obtain one.
