<h4>WHAT?! I DON'T NEED WONDERFLEX FOR EVERYTHING? (a guide to cosplay materials and construction)</h4>
<p><em>During this hour we will demonstrate advantages and disadvantages of materials commonly used in cosplay. We will discuss how to combine these traits to save time and improve quality.  We will cover were to find these materials in the Chicago-land area specifically and some strategies to make the most of your money. If there is time we may share some first-hand experiences and advice followed by Q&amp;A.</em></p>

<h4>A.N.I.M.E Force (Anti Necrotic-Infection Monitoring Elite Force)</h4>
<p><em>This is a panel to discuss general zombie apocalypse survival tactics and tips in a hypothetical zombie apocalypse setting. These tactics and tips will cover aspects like setting up camps, fortifications, temporary bases of operations, weapons, travel, supplies, etc.</em></p>

<h4>Hetalia Ask-a-Nation</h4>
<p><em>A Q&amp;A with your favorite nations from Hetalia</em></p>

<h4>Blurred Lines: Legal and Literary Issues in Fanfiction</h4>
<p><em>A discussion of precedents to modern fanfiction, the fluid boundaries of "fanfiction" (what distinguishes say, Wicked, from AU fanfiction? What about Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead?), the historical precedents leading to fanfiction's legal status today, and a discussion of both the modern culture of fanfiction and its future. Format is half-lecture, half-discussion.</em></p>

<h4>The Absolute Best in Bad Fanfiction</h4>
<p><em>This panel will deal with two issues: 1.) The actual art and incredible amusement of writing poorly, and 2.) the literary issues that surround fanfiction genres. At this panel, we will be discussing several fanfictions, some famous, some not-so-famous, that exist within the Anime community. Hetalia fiction, Metal Gear Solid fanfiction, Pokemon fanfiction, and everything Studio Ghibli will be touched, and more. We will discuss tropes that appear in these fanfictions, as well as changes to character development within the fiction that alters the canon of the show. This panel is rated PG-13, as it will contain some language and very mild sexual content (kissing, making out, shipping, various relationships, etc.), so keep this in mind before attending the panel. We would also like to request that the audience also adhere to this rating, so please keep your questions/comments as clean as possible. At the start of the panel, we will begin "Bad Fic Bingo" with bingo cards to fill out during the panel and prizes for attendees. We will read segments of fanfictions, discuss the tropes, characterization, and bad-on-purpose jokes in the context of Japanese society and the canon of the original show or game.</em></p>

<h4>The Past, Present and Future of Chicago's Anime Scene</h4>
<p><em>New to Chicago or just curious about the local anime community? Several anime veterans discuss over 20 years of Chicago’s anime history, how anime communities around the world connect locally, how journalism sustains industry, and much more! The Windy City has potential to become the Anime Capital of the West. Find out how at this panel!</em></p>


<h4>Retro Games: A Trip Down Memory Lane</h4>
<p><em>I'm a video game enthusiast who'd like to share my knowledge of retro video games with others! This panel would be examining a selection of video games and their systems from the past.</em></p> 

<h4>Auteurs in Anime: Visions in Anime </h4>
<p><em>This panel will be a look into the auteur theory and how it applies to major anime figures, both old and new. Anime is produced by hundreds of craftsmen, much like any motion picture, but there are times when a director has such a distinct vision, their story is told through the hard work and multitude of hands that pass through a project.  Examples of this can be seen in the works of Akiyuki Shinbo (Puella Magi Madoka Magica), Satoshi Kon (Perfect Blue) and Hiroyuki Imaishi (Kill la Kill).</em></p>

<h4>Sburb Anonymous</h4>
<p><em>A Q&amp;A panel for the beta cast of Homestuck. Come ask questions and chat with them in a dream bubble!</em></p>

<h4>Beforus Anonymous</h4>
<p><em>A Q&amp;A for the beforus trolls from homestuck. Come join them in a magical dream bubble and ask them questions!</em></p>
