As of this year, we will only be offering badges to attendees who [pre-register](/uchi-con/registration). If you choose to register day-of, you will instead receive a wristband. Both methods are, as always, free.

[Pre-Registration](/uchi-con/registration) will close on 29 Jan at 12pm.

As for why we are making this choice, the fact of the matter is that our staff and volunteers combined only number about 40-ish people. Last year, we received 400 pre-registrations. Attendance last year was 800+. We love our attendees, but it's hard to accommodate such a drastic change in attendance. So in case anyone was wondering why we ran out of food around 1pm and were writing badge names on masking tape last year, here's your answer. We very much appreciate everyone sticking around while we try to figure out how much food to make and how to reorganize our building layouts.

As such, we're trying to create more incentives for people to pre-register. We cannot emphasize how important it is that you pre-register and sincerely hope that you will choose to do so.
